## TODO 3.0 (React)



Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

This is a React implementation of my task tracker from A3. It has a new feature of the 'Create' button changing to 'Modify' and the 'Delete' button appearing when a task is selected. React made it much easier to add this feature, as I used a state to keep track of whether any checkboxes were checked. Conditional rendering, useState, and useEffect altogether made the dev experience much better than vanilla JS.
